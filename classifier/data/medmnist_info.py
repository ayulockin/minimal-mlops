The dataset is comprised of 9 types of tissues, resulting in a multi-class classification task. We resize the source images of 3×224×224 into 3×28×28, and split NCT-CRC-HE-100K into training and validation set with a ratio of 9:1. The CRC-VAL-HE-7K is treated as the test set.",

        "The NoduleMNIST3D is based on the LIDC-IDRI, a large public lung nodule dataset, containing images from thoracic CT scans. The dataset is designed for both lung nodule segmentation and 5-level malignancy classification task. To perform binary classification, we categorize cases with malignancy level 1/2 into negative class and 4/5 into positive class, ignoring the cases with malignancy level 3. We split the source dataset with a ratio of 7:1:2 into training, validation and test set, and center-crop the spatially normalized images (with a spacing of 1mm×1mm×1mm) into 28×28×28.",

        "The AdrenalMNIST3D is a new 3D shape classification dataset, consisting of shape masks from 1,584 left and right adrenal glands (i.e., 792 patients). Collected from Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University, each 3D shape of adrenal gland is annotated by an expert endocrinologist using abdominal computed tomography (CT), together with a binary classification label of normal adrenal gland or adrenal mass. Considering patient privacy, we do not provide the source CT scans, but the real 3D shapes of adrenal glands and their classification labels. We calculate the center of adrenal and resize the center-cropped 64mm×64mm×64mm volume into 28×28×28. The dataset is randomly split into training/validation/test set of 1,188/98/298 on a patient level.",

As we use low-resolution images, we disregard segmental rib fractures and classify 3 types of rib fractures (i.e., buckle, nondisplaced, and displaced). For each annotated fracture area, we calculate its center and resize the center-cropped 64mm×64mm×64mm image into 28×28×28. The official split of training, validation and test set is used.",

It uses a 3D image volume of an adult rat acquired by a multi-beam scanning electron microscope. The original data is of the size 100×100×100um^3 and the resolution 8×8×30nm^3, where a (30um)^3 sub-volume was used in the MitoEM dataset with dense 3D mitochondria instance segmentation labels. Three neuroscience experts segment a pyramidal neuron within the whole volume and proofread all the synapses on this neuron with excitatory/inhibitory labels. For each labeled synaptic location, we crop a 3D volume of 1024×1024×1024nm^3 and resize it into 28×28×28 voxels. Finally, the dataset is randomly split with a ratio of 7:1:2 into training, validation and test set.",
